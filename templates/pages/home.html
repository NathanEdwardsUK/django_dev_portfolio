      Hello! I'm a software developer and former trader with 5 years experience working at top-tier
      algorithmic-trading
      firm Flow Traders.
      I've been head of multiple desks, product owner of critical trading applications and a member of the Trader Tech
      Team.
      I specialised in designing, building and operating world-class higly-automated trading systems.
      <br><br>
      I strongly believe in the importance of continuous learning and I built this website both to demonstrate what I
      know and as a learning project in itself to discover the wonders of web development.

        Described as a "zero player game" by it's creator, mathematician John Conway,
        the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> composes of a grid of
        cells, which are either dead or alive, and has a simple set of rules
        which
        decide whether each cell will be alive or dead in the next turn.<br><br>
        Conway invented the game as a demonstration that simple rules and the right starting conditions
        can lead to chaotic and even self replicating systems.<br><br>
        As a mathematics undergrad I was fascinated by this concept. <a href="{% url 'sandbox' %}">Checkout my sandbox
          implementation here</a>. You can play around with setting up your own patterns and seeing how the game
        evolves, or choose from a dropdown list of amazing community discovered automata like the ones you see above.
