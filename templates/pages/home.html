        Hello! I'm a software developer and former trader with 5 years experience working at top-tier
        algorithmic-trading
        firm Flow Traders.
        I've been head of multiple desks, product owner of critical trading applications and a member of the Trader Tech
        Team.
        I specialised in designing, building and operating world-class higly-automated trading systems.
        <br><br>
        I strongly believe in the importance of continuous learning and I built this website both to demonstrate what I
        know and as a learning project in itself to discover the wonders of web development.

          Described as a "zero player game" by it's creator, mathematician John Conway,
          the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Game of Life</a> composes of a grid of
          cells, which are either dead or alive, and has a simple set of rules
          which
          decide whether each cell will be alive or dead in the next turn.<br><br>
          Conway invented the game as a demonstration that simple rules and the right starting conditions
          can lead to chaotic and even self replicating systems.<br><br>
          As a mathematics undergrad I was fascinated by this concept. <a href="{% url 'sandbox' %}">Checkout my sandbox
            implementation here</a>. You can play around with setting up your own patterns and seeing how the game
          evolves, or choose from a dropdown list of amazing community discovered automata like the ones you see above.
